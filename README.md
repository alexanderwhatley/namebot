# Namebot
A company/product name generating tool written in Python. Powers parts of Automotron.com

## Notes:
This project is ongoing, but feel free to contribute! There's much more to add, but it's a full-fledged suite of tools that can help you get started generating ideas and names.

## Modules: 
### Examples
Some pregenerated examples for testing. This should be used for marshalling data into the views.

### Metrics
A class of utilities for generating all kinds of linguistic metrics for a set of words.

### NLP
Natural language processing tools for finding word relationships - uses NLTK for all of the heavy-lifting.

### Normalization
Some tools for normalizing and formatting content for use with the rest of the library.

### Scoring
Some scoring algorithms, primarily for classifying pronunciation, such as Soundex or Double Metaphone.

### Techniques
The major chunk of work represented in this library. The many techniques I've created after researching hundreds of corporate names and naming agency techniques
